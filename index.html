<div class="About-col">
<h3>Education Background</h3>
<p>I graduated in Mathematics Physics and Computer Science at Byimana School of Sciences, Ruhango-Southern Province.
Highscool opened my eyes and mind to loving tech, i remember choosing computer science over other subjects as my favorite more than once. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Business Information Technology at Mt Kenya university, Kicukiro Campus. you have got to love how tech field is wide, you think you know it all and then boom; another update or something you have never heard about at all. I am hoping to become better, learning never stop. so is me!</p>

<h3>My Work Experience</h3>
<p> I've worked with 5 different insitutions here in Rwanda. From hospitality industry, auto-mobiles to tech solution providers, I have sales work-related experience and customer services. I got my first Job at the age of 19, it was difficult to maintain proffessionalism at first but with time I adjusted and I am grateful to my supervisors who believed in me and guided me to becoming better. I do not limit myself when it comes to jobs, and i am still exploring what I am good at anyways, the need to learn and see how far I can go can't let me to see an opportunity go, in the end I've got nothing to loose when I've gotten experience. <br> Do not hesitate to reach out to me for more, I have my contacts listed here. </p>

<h3>Hobbies and Aspirations</h3>
<p>I love learning new skills, whatever pushes me to doing that I am into it. I enjoy reading historcal books, watching fiction and comedy movies and cooking. I love spending time with my family and friends. moreover; Sundays are for church services. I belive that good things take time, that's what keep me going. I want to become a useful person to the society, I would be lying if I say; i've got everything figured out because I haven't, but everyday i challenge myself to become better. Sometimes, I am at the verge of giving up (who doesn't?) but then i remind myself that I did't come this far to quit.</p>
